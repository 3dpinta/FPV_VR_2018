Abstractions for drawing different OpenGL Elements like
-colored geometry (GLRenderColor)
-textured geometry
        -using a "normal" OpenGL texture sampler (GLRenderTexture)
        -using a "external texture" OpenGL sampler (GLRenderTextureExternal)
and for drawing text btw. strings in 3D OpenGL space (GLRenderText), sampling from a TextAtlas texture

The vertex/fragment shaders are stored in ../Helper/GLHelper.h
They all support vertex displacement distortion correction

07.12.2017:
They are each created & passed using a shared_ptr

12.12.2017:
Additional GLRenderLine class:
this is only used to draw the "seperator" line for a VR headset, and does not support Vertex displacement distortion correction
deprecated: using GvrLayout instead
